Climate change with emphasis on heat waves
The subject of this thesis is the study of climate change, as well as extreme weather phenomena with an emphasis on the heat waves experienced by various European cities. For this particular study, climate data from Cordex for the period 1971-2020 and data from regional models for the future were needed. Specifically, the model EUR-11_MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR was used for two scenarios rcp45 and rcp85. These data are corrected and adjusted accordingly the bias adjustment method (will be further elaborated in the introduction). Then the data were processed and through programming algorithms, files were extracted which contained the three parameters we are interested in (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation) for each day for period 1971-2100 separately for each scenario. Finally, using Climpact, all climate indices were calculated for each scenario and city.
 Having completed the first part of the extraction of the data and the calculation of the climate indices, the second part follows in which the results are analyzed, and the conclusions drawn for each city separately. Through this analysis a conclusion is expected to be drawn, firstly, whether there are changes in the intensity, duration and frequency of heatwaves, secondly, whether changes in heatwaves are expected to occur in the future and lastly whether climate change affects each of the cities.
